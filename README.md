# Psychic-Game

* The purpose of the project is to create a letter guessing game.
* The user attempts to guess the letter that the computer has randomly selected.
* If the user is correct, their wins category goes up by 1. However, if the user guesses incorrectly 9 times their loss category goes up by 1. 
* The game also keeps track of the different letters the user has guessed.

* The project allows the user to interact with a program in an entertaining way.

* The user can get started with the project simply by hitting a letter on the keyboard.
